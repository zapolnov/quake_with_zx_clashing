WinQuake patched with ZX Spectrum clashing support.

Run game and press:
* F5 - switch to clashing mode
* F4 - switch to b/w mode
* F3 - switch to normal mode
* PageUp/PageDown - zoom in and out

If you want to compile yourself, use CMake.
Tested on Visual Studio 2019 and MinGW 8.10.

Only Windows is currently supported.
